    <h2>Carson Alonzo | Web Client Applications</h2>

    1. Make a form that contains a bunch of different features described in the W3schools lessons Form Elements,  Form input types, and Form attributes. Each feature should have a label explaining what it does. Make your action handler be https://www.w3schools.com/action_page.php and be sure the form has a "submit" input type. You may start with the form from the previous HW if you like. Put this form in an existing page that already has buttons to demonstrate things from earlier HW(s), or make a new page if you prefer.

2. Make a small game or demo in which you use setTimeOut() and/or clearTimeOut() along with buttons, showing how these work. Add it to your buttons page.
