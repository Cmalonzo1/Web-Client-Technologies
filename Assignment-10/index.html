    <h1>Assignment </h1>
    <h2>Carson Alonzo | Web Client Applications</h2>

    1. a. Exercise 1 in the W3schools "HTML Forms" lesson, linked from the lecture schedule in the syllabus. Give what you typed in, or a screen shot.

  b. Exercise 2 in HTML Forms.

  c. Exercise 1 in HTML Form Elements.

  d. Exercise 2 in HTML Form Elements.

  e. Exercise 3 in HTML Form Elements.

2.    For an html form’s submit input type, what does the name attribute do? The value attribute?

3.    Explain how secure the HTML form input type password is.

4.    Write a form. Include a bunch of different kinds/variations of form elements. The page should contain examples of various <input> types and attributes, along with accompanying HTML text that explains what happens. Merge this with the button collection from your previous HW, or start a new demo page without the previous buttons if you prefer.

5.    Make the form submit its data to https://www.w3schools.com/action_page.php for processing. It should result in a page displaying something like this:

Submitted Form Data

Your input was received as:

__________________________________________________

firstName=John&lastName=Doe                                            

The server has processed your input and returned this answer.

Note: This tutorial will not teach you how servers are processing input. Processing input is explained in our PHP tutorial.



Submit your code. It will be mostly the same as for Q3, since it just adds one more item of functionality.

 

6.      Consider the form and form handler example at https://dberleant.github.io/IFSC3300/lectureFormProcessingExample.html that was discussed in class. Get the source code from the "View page source" functionality of your web browser (on Chrome, right click on the page, then click on “View page source”). Add comments to it by filling in the blank comments numbers 1 through 33. (The first few comments are HTML comments, not JavaScript comments, and are bracketed according to <!- this is an HTML comment>.)
IMPORTANT: Send this in the body of your email. In particular, do not submit as a link to a google drive document, because your comments will not show if someone clicks the link (they would have to remember to download the document and then load it into an editor).
