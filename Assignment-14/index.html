        <p>Cookies store information about your visit to a webpage. Things like passwords, settings, and website preferences are stored in cookies. Because of the sensitive information typically stored in cookies, companies employ strict security measures such as:
            <ul>
                <li>ensuring the cookies cannot be accessed through the user's client</li>
                <li>implementing short and reasonable cookie expiration times</li>
                <li>encrypting user's sensitive information</li>
            </ul>
            to ensure the user's data is not compromised.</p>
            <p>Users, especially privacy conscious ones, have tools in the browser and webpage that allow them to protect their data. They may use incognito mode on their browser to prevent cookies from being stored, or can periodically delete them within their history settings.</p>
            <p>Cookies are a powerful tool that help enhance the user experience but must be used with caution to protect the user's data and the company's reputation.</p>
        <li>Write code with buttons that: create a cookie with attribute "flavor" and value "chocolate chip" (or whatever your favorite kind is); displays the cookie; and changes the cookie value.

(Don't do the below, it is here for historical and perhaps future purposes only.)

4. Consider W3school's page on JS support for local storage. It has a "Try it Yourself" sandbox that has code you can modify for this problem if you like.

a) Create a variable called myObj and define it to have an address attribute and, as its value, some string like "33 Main St., Little Rock" or whatever you like.
b) Modify the setItem() call to be setItem("JSONstring", _______) where the underlined portion contains a call to stringify myObj. This will store your object as JSON text in the brower's hidden local storage area in a virtual file called JSONstring
c)Print the value of the stringified myObj so you can see what it looks like.
d) Modify the getItem() call and add any code necessary to retrieve the JSON text, parse it back into an object, and print the address.

Note to instructor: another possible cookies problem to consider for future use is:  Type into a form and save into cookies, using the example I gave for processing a form in its own web page.
